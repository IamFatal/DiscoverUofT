# DiscoverUofT

We've all been in situations where we had difficulty finding spaces for personal or group work and, as of right now, our university doesn't offer a comprehensive and centralized solution to address this problem. Currently, we can reserve special study rooms in advance in buildings like Robarts and Bahen, individually look up lecture timings for each room, or check rooms one-by-one to find an available one.

Our app steps in to provide University of Toronto students and faculty with a quick and easy way to find free spaces (lecture halls, classrooms, etc.) that they can use to study, play, work, or find others who are doing similar activities.
